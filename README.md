## Population and logistic map

The logistic map is a polynomial mapping (equivalently, recurrence relation) of degree 2, often cited as an archetypal example of how complex, chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple non-linear dynamical equations. The map was popularized in a 1976 paper by the biologist Robert May, in part as a discrete-time demographic model analogous to the logistic equation written down by Pierre Fran√ßois Verhulst. Mathematically, the logistic map is written

`x[n+1] = r x[n] (1 - x[n])`

where `x[n]` is a number between zero and one, that represents the ratio of existing population to the maximum possible population. This nonlinear difference equation is intended to capture two effects:

* `reproduction` where the population will increase at a rate proportional to the current population when the population size is small.
* `starvation` (density-dependent mortality) where the growth rate will decrease at a rate proportional to the value obtained by taking the theoretical "carrying capacity" of the environment less the current population.
